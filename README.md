Building a sign language glove using an Arduino.

As part of our IoT Assignment myself and Lana have designed and built a sign language glove using an Arduino.

We have used five flex sensors along with a series of wires and resistors. When the user moves or bends their hand in certain ways (following sign language rules) the data is displayed on the screen on an app we have built.

At this current stage we have managed to get the glove to recorgnise a few letters from the alphabet. We did this by logging the resitance and setting it to a variable called bend. We then had a series of statements that would change the letter based on these specific bends.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
